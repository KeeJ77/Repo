            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently a third-year Computer Science student pursuing a BSc at Wits University. As a Cyber Security enthusiast, I enjoy finding new and challenging ways to test my skills through platforms like TryHackMe. My passion for technology drives me to continuously learn and grow, while exploring various aspects of cybersecurity, programming, and problem-solving. I’m excited to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                My latest project is a mobile application called 'Freelancers', designed to provide job opportunities to individuals who lack formal qualifications and are not represented on platforms like LinkedIn. The app connects users with short-term and freelance jobs that match their skills and interests, regardless of their educational background. It aims to bridge the gap for those who might struggle to find work through traditional channels. By providing access to meaningful employment, 'Helping Hand' empowers individuals to gain work experience, earn income, and improve their lives, while helping businesses find reliable, qualified workers for temporary roles.
